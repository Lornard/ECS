	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_CSE_MAI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1",	"Ma-i or Maidh was an ancient sovereign state located in what is now the Philippines, notable in Philippine historiography for being the first place in the Philippines ever to be mentioned in any foreign account. Its existence was first documented in 971 AD, in the Song Dynasty documents known as the History of Song, and it was also mentioned in the 10th century records of the Sultanate of Brunei. Based on these and other mentions until the early 14th century, contemporary scholars believe Ma-i was located either in Bay, Laguna or on the island of Mindoro."	),
	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_CSE_MAI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2",	"Because all the documents describing Ma-I were primarily concerned with trade, this is the most documented aspect of Ma-I culture. Both the Song Dynasty records (specifically the Zhu Fan Zhi), and Yuan Dynasty records (specifically the Daoyi Zhilüe) describe the local products as 'kapok cotton, yellow bees-wax, tortoise shell, medicinal betel nuts and cloth of various patterns.' The Zhu Fan Zhi notes that in exchange, the locals accepted products such as 'porcelain, trade gold, iron pots, lead, colored glass beads, and iron needles.' The Daoyi Zhilüe later lists 'caldrons, pieces of iron, red cloth or taffetas of various color stripes, ivory, and 'tint or the like'' as accepted items of exchange."	),
	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_CSE_MAI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3",	"No mentions of the country of Ma-i have been found after 1349 (or 1339 depending on the source). However, historians generally believe that Ma-i continued to exist under a different name. Early theories for the location of Ma-i include locations in Central Luzon, or the Southern Tagalog area. Many 20th Century Scholars came to accept the idea that Ma-i was located on the island of Mindoro, based on the name of Mait, a place on the island. However, this has been questioned on the basis of physical evidence and an analysis of Chinese orthography, and Bay (pronounced 'Ba-i' or 'Ba-e' by locals) has once again been suggested as a likely location of Ma-i."	),
	("en_US",	"LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_CSE_MAI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4",	"Whatever happened to Ma-i between the last time it was mentioned by documents at the end of the Tang Dynasty in the 1300s and the beginning of Philippines Spanish in the 1570s, both Mindoro and Bay eventually became part of the Philippine Islands under the dominion of Spain."	);
